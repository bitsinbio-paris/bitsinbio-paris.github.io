I have been following the field of the emerging techbio industry for a few years from
a distance during my PhD, and have been a bit keener in my interest about it in the last few
months. Realizing I was spending quite some time doing it each day, by actually going through
the news coverage and annotating them, I decided to have other folks benefit from my new
procrastination habit.

Here is thus the first occurrence of "This Week In TechBio", a series of short blog posts
listing all the news coverage I could find about Techbio, and the use of AI in the biotech
and pharma industry in general, with a short summary of each.

# This Week in TechBio 2024/01/01 

There were rather a lot of cool announcements prior to JPMH24, one thing that particularly striked
me is that Isomorphic Labs and MOMA Therapeutics both signed rather large deals with pretty good
royalties, while doing little to no clinical work. This bodes very well for the TechBio industry
as they will be able to focus on what they are good at (finding good candidates), and let pharma
do what they are good at (running trials, regulation, and marketting).

Insitro announces 3 papers ahead of JPMH24, [an H&E foundation model](https://www.insitro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/insitro-oncology-biomarker-2024.pdf)
with the [associated twitter thread](https://x.com/chrisprobert/status/1744421618821321031?s=20) by the last author,
one [predicting liver fat content from three modalities in UKB](https://www.insitro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/insitro-lipogenesis-biomaker-2024-1.pdf),
and one on [ALS using deep learning and iPSC to better understand its mechanisms](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.04.574270v2).

- [2024/01/07 Isomorphic Labs:](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/isomorphic-labs-kicks-off-2024-with-two-pharmaceutical-collaborations)
Iso announces a collaboration with both Eli Lilly and Novartis, both deals are kinda crazy because
to the best of my knowledge Iso just started their bioinformatics and computational chemistry teams,
and mostly have core ML folks; both deals are super likely pre-IND because they seem to neither
have a wetlab for the pre-clinical work, nor a clinical team for actual trials. The fact that both
deals could be in the two digits for royalties pre-IND is pretty incredible.
  - [Eli Lilly deal](https://storage.googleapis.com/isomorphiclabs-website-public-artifacts/ISOMORPHIC%20LABS_ELI_LILLY_07_01_24.pdf):
  \\$45m upfront, up to \\$1.700m in milestones, and low two digits in royalties, working on

# Honorable mentions from december

There were also a few very interesting announcements in the month of December, but my notetaking was
less than stellar them, so here they are bunched up together:

- [Inductive](https://www.inductive.bio/), a compnay focusing on ADMET lead optimisation, got out
of stealth and also plans on working on pre-IND tasks.
- AstraZeneca signed a \\$247m deal with [AbSci](https://www.absci.com/) for an antibody design
collaboration (source: [Fierce Biotech](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/astrazeneca-inks-247m-ai-enabled-oncology-antibody-design-pact-joining-abscis-list-pharma)).
- Sanofi continues its AI shopping spree, with a \\$140m deal with [Aqemia](https://www.aqemia.com/),
focusing on small molecules design (source: [Fierce Biotech](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/sanofi-spins-ai-pact-inking-140m-deal-apply-aqemias-physics-algorithms-drug-discovery)).
- AbbVie signs a \\$30m upfront, and \\$325m in milestones, deal with [BigHat Biosciences](https://www.bighatbio.com/)
for antibody design (source: [AbbVie](https://news.abbvie.com/2023-12-05-AbbVie-and-BigHat-Biosciences-Announce-Research-Collaboration-to-Leverage-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-to-Discover-Next-Generation-Therapeutic-Antibodies)).
- [Atomic AI](https://atomic.ai/) comes out of stealth with a \\$35m series A deal, they will be
focused on all things RNA and released their RNA foundation model [ATOM-1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.13.571579v1)
at the same time (source: [BusinessWire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230125005256/en/Atomic-AI-Launches-with-35-Million-Series-A-Financing-to-Advance-AI-driven-RNA-Structure-Platform-for-Treating-Undruggable-Diseases)).
- Owkin also inked quite a few deals.

It is rather interesting to see the new word "AI Pact" come up, it seems that many pharma companies
want to get their own AI labs (like Recursion when they [acquired Valence labs](https://ir.recursion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/recursion-launches-valence-labs-icml-commitment-open-science)).

I am a bit curious about whether all these newfound AI labs will be able to provide value to their
new corporate overlords of if this is signaling / FOMO on the pharma side, time will tell.


I probably missed quite a few announcements, don't hesitate to DM me [@gama_search](https://twitter.com/gama_search)
if you see anything missing or needing corrections.
