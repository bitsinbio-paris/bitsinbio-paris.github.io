# Introducing "This week in Techbio"

I have been following the field of thr emerging techbio industry for a few years from
a distance during my PhD, and have been a bit keener in my interest about it in the last few
months. Realizing I was spending quite some time doing it each day, by actually going through
the news coverage and annotating them, I decided to have other folks benefit from my new
procrastination habit.

Here is thus the first occurrence of "This Week In TechBio", a series of short blog posts
listing all the news coverage I could find about Techbio, and the use of AI in the biotech
and pharma industry in general, with a short summary of each.

[2024/01/07 STAT:](https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/07/jpm-2024-insitro-biotech-ai-drug-development-cancer-als-liver-disease/?utm_campaign=twitter_organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) Insitro announces 3 papers ahead of JPMH24, [one on H&E](https://www.insitro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/insitro-oncology-biomarker-2024.pdf) predictions, one [predicting liver fat content from three modalities in UKB](https://www.insitro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/insitro-lipogenesis-biomaker-2024-1.pdf), and one on [ALS using deep learning and iPSC to better understand its mechanisms](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.04.574270v2). 

[2024/01/07 Isomorphic Labs:](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/isomorphic-labs-kicks-off-2024-with-two-pharmaceutical-collaborations) Iso announces a collaboration with both Eli Lilly and Novartis, both deals are kinda crazy because to the best of my knowledge Iso just started their bioinformatics and computational chemistry teams, and mostly have core ML folks; both deals are super likely pre-IND because they seem to neither have a wetlab for the pre-clinical work, nor a clinical team for actual trials. The fact that both deals could be in the two digits for royalties pre-IND is pretty incredible.

- [Eli Lilly deal](https://storage.googleapis.com/isomorphiclabs-website-public-artifacts/ISOMORPHIC%20LABS_ELI_LILLY_07_01_24.pdf): $45m upfront, up to $1.700m in milestones, and low two digits in royalties, working on “drug discovery”
- [Novartis deal:](https://storage.googleapis.com/isomorphiclabs-website-public-artifacts/ISOMORPHIC%20LABS_NOVARTIS_07_01_24.pdf) $37.5m upfront, up to $1.200m in milestones, and mid-single to low-double in royalties for  “small molecules”
