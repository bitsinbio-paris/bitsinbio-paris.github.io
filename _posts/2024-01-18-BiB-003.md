This month we are happy to welcome Dr. Gabriel Dumy from [Kolibri](https://www.kolibrilab.com/)
and [Dr. Gregory Batt](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/department/computational-biology/) from INRIA and Institut Pasteur.
for two talks on the use of AI for clinical trial design and analysis:

- Gabriel Dumy will present how we can use accoustic waves to design better bioreactors.
- Gregory Batt will present some of his recent work in the ["Maximizing protein production by keeping cells at optimal secretory stress levels using real-time control approaches"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38807-9) paper.

The events is hosted at the Hotel Dieu starting at 7pm on 2024/01/18.
