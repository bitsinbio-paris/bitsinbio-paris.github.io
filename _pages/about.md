I'm a computational biologist interested in leveraging computational approaches, machine learning in particular, for understanding the natural sciences.

I'll be joining the lab of [Dr. Jill Moore](https://www.moore-lab.org/home) at
[UMass Chan Medical School](https://www.umassmed.edu/) in February 2024 to work on multi-omics data.

Prior to that I have done my PhD at Google Brain and [Institut Curie](https://curie.fr/), under the supervision of [Dr. Jean-Philippe Vert](https://jpvert.github.io/) and [Dr. Celine Vallot](https://curie.fr/personne/celine-vallot). I worked on single-cell data analysis with a focus on the reliability of unsupervised learning.

My thesis is available for consultation ([manuscript](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dX3cWvHgYpPuu1pypW9gWX5W3i9Kc_Xa/view?usp=sharing), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d9BdVEOqfCx-f4dQsPHoSE6gcIxI1pVg2Tqw0TqJk2c/edit?usp=sharing)).

Prior to this I studied embedded systems and computer science at Telecom Paris, where I did some [cool projects](https://www.hackster.io/gamazeps).

On my free time I like to [paint plastic toys](https://www.instagram.com/gamazeps/) and take care of my baby cat (even though he is a chonker).
