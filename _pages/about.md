I'm a computational biologist interetsed in leveraging computational approaches for understanding the matural sciences.

Prior to that I have done my PhD at Google Brain and [Institut Curie](https://curie.fr/), under the supervision of [Dr. Jean-Philippe Vert](https://jpvert.github.io/) and [Dr. Celine Vallot](https://curie.fr/personne/celine-vallot). I worked on single-cell data analysis with a focus on the reliability of unsupervised learning.

My thesis is available for consultation ([manuscript](), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d9BdVEOqfCx-f4dQsPHoSE6gcIxI1pVg2Tqw0TqJk2c/edit?usp=sharing)).

Prior to this I studied embedded systems and computer science at Telecom Paris, where I did some [cool projects](https://www.hackster.io/gamazeps).

On my free time I like to [paint plastic toys](https://www.instagram.com/gamazeps/) and take care of my baby cat (even though he is a chonker).
