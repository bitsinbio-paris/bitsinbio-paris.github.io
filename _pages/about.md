[Bits in bio](https://www.bitsinbio.org/) is a series of meetups organized around the world, and this
page is dedicated to the ones happening in Paris.

Its goal is to bring together all actors in the field of biology and computer sciences, be it scientists,
engineers, medical practitionners, entrepreneurs, healthcare professionals, and everything in between.

We are meeting on a monthy-ish basis at the [Biolabs in Hotel Dieu](https://www.biolabs.io/hotel-dieu),
right next to the Notre Dame cathedral.
